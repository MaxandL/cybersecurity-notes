## Linux Structure

Linux, is a robust operating system, flexibility, and open-source operating system. An operating system (OS) is software that manages all the hardware resources of a computer, facilitating communication between software applications and hardware componentsy. Linux comes in many different distributions often called "distros " which are versions of Linux tailored to various needs and preferences such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Kali Linux, and Parrot OS. .

## Linux Philosophy

- Everything is a file.
- Small programs that perform one task well which can be combined to work together.
- Combine programs together to solve complex problems
- Gives the user greater control over the operating system.
- Configuration data stored in a text file

## Linux Components

- Bootloader – run the booting process to start the operating system.
- Kernel – manages the resources for system's I/O devices at the hardware level.
- Daemons – Background services that keep the system running correctly.
- OS Shell – is the interface between the OS and the user. This interface allows the user to tell the OS what to do.
- Graphics server – Provides the graphical environment.
- Window Manager – Manages windows and the graphical desktop.
- Utilities – Programs and tools used by the user.

## Linux Architecture

The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:
- Hardware
- Kernel
- Shell
- System Utility

## Linux File System Hierarchy

- /	    ->  Root directory containing the entire filesystem.
- /bin	->  Essential user commands.
- /boot	->  Bootloader and kernel files.
- /dev	->  Device files.
- /etc	->  System configuration files.
- /home	->  User home directories.
- /lib	->  Shared libraries.
- /media ->	Removable media.
- /mnt	->  Temporary mount points.
- /opt	->  Optional third-party software.
- /root	->  Home directory of the root user.
- /sbin	->  System administration binaries.
- /tmp	->  Temporary files.
- /usr	->  User applications and libraries.
- /var	->  Variable data such as logs and caches.

## Terminal & Shell

- The Linux terminal is the interface that allows the user to communicate with the operating system by entering text commands.
- The shell interprets those commands and sends them to the Linux kernel to execute them.
- Terminal emulators simulate a physical terminal inside a graphical interface (GUI), allowing users to access the shell without using a real console.
- Tools like Tmux extend the terminal's functionality by allowing multiple sessions, panes, and workspaces in a single window.

## Prompt

The Bash prompt is the command line displayed in the terminal that indicates the system is ready to receive commands. It shows useful information such as the current user, the hostname, and the current working directory. The prompt can be customized by modifying the `PS1` variable to display additional information like the date, time, IP address, or full directory path, making it more useful during penetration testing and system administration.

## Default Prompt

```bash
<username>@<hostname><current_directory>$
```

## Prompt Symbols

| Symbol | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `$` | Regular user prompt |
| `#` | Root (privileged) user prompt |
| `~` | User's home directory |

## PS1 Special Characters

- `\u` → Current username
- `\h` → Hostname
- `\H` → Full hostname
- `\w` → Full current working directory
- `\d` → Current date
- `\t` → Current time (24-hour format)
- `\T` → Current time (12-hour format)
- `\@` → Current time
- `\n` → New line
- `\s` → Shell name
- `\j` → Number of background jobs

## Getting Help

This section explains how to find information about Linux commands by yourself instead of memorizing everything. It introduces the `ls` command as an example and shows how to use tools like `man`, `--help`, `-h`, and `apropos` to understand what commands do, their syntax, and available options. The main idea is to become independent and learn how to search for command documentation whenever needed.

## Useful Commands

- `ls` → List files and directories.
- `man <command>` → Open the complete manual page.
- `<command> --help` → Display a quick help menu with available options.
- `<command> -h` → Show a short help menu (supported by some commands).
- `apropos <keyword>` → Search for commands related to a keyword.
